![Document Processing Pipeline](document-processing-pipeline.png)

The document processing implementation includes:

```python
def process_document(file_path: str) -> Tuple[str, List]:
    """Process a document file and extract text and images."""
    file_extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)[1].lower()
    
    if file_extension == '.pdf':
        try:
            # Primary method using Unstructured
            elements = partition_pdf(filename=file_path)
            elements_json = elements_to_json(elements)
            text_content = "\n".join([elem.get('text', '') 
                                    for elem in elements_json])
            
            if not text_content.strip():
                # Fallback method using PyMuPDF
                return process_pdf_with_pymupdf(file_path)
                
            return text_content.strip(), []
            
        except Exception:
            return process_pdf_with_pymupdf(file_path)
```

### 3.2 Advanced Text Chunking Strategies

The system implements sophisticated chunking approaches that combine semantic understanding with optimal content segmentation:

#### 3.2.1 Semantic Chunking

The semantic chunking pipeline processes documents through multiple stages:

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and normalization
   - Initial boundary detection
   - Entity recognition

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Topic detection and clustering
   - Entity relationship mapping
   - Natural boundary identification

3. **Chunk Optimization**:
   - Topic coherence verification
   - Entity coverage balancing
   - Size optimization

#### 3.2.2 Sliding Window Implementation

The system employs a dynamic sliding window approach:

- Primary window size: 1000 characters
- Overlap region: 200 characters
- Progressive movement: 200-character increments

Key features:
- Continuous context tracking
- Entity preservation across chunks
- Reference resolution
- Topic continuity maintenance

The sliding window process is illustrated below:

#### 3.2.3 Context Preservation Mechanisms

Multiple mechanisms ensure context integrity:
1. Entity Tracking:
   - Cross-chunk entity linking
   - Coreference resolution
   - Relationship maintenance

2. Reference Resolution:
   - Anaphora resolution across chunks
   - Maintaining citation context
   - Preserving numerical references

3. Semantic Coherence:
   - Topic flow maintenance
   - Argument structure preservation
   - Logical connection retention

### 4.2 Node Classification and Embedding Process

![Node Classification](Node-Classification.png)

### 4.3 Graph Construction and Indexing

The knowledge graph is constructed using a multi-layer approach:

![Graph Construction and Indexing](Graph-Construction-and-Indexing.png)

Key Features:
1. **Node Types**:
   - Document nodes (source documents)
   - Chunk nodes (processed segments)
   - Entity nodes (extracted entities)
   - Topic nodes (semantic topics)

2. **Vector Integration**:

## 5. Retrieval Mechanism

### 5.1 Enhanced Query Processing and Retrieval

The system implements a sophisticated multi-stage retrieval and re-ranking approach:

#### 5.1.1 Initial Retrieval

```python
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes(
    'content_embeddings',
    5,  // top-k results
    $query_embedding
) YIELD node, score
```

2. **Initial Ranking**:

   - Topic alignment

2. **Entity Overlap**:
   - Named entity matching
   - Concept correlation
   - Relationship strength

3. **Position and Structure**:
   - Document location
   - Hierarchical importance
   - Cross-reference density

#### 5.1.3 Chunk Fusion Process

The system implements intelligent chunk fusion:

![Chunk Fusion](reranking-chunk-fusion.png)

1. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Inter-chunk relationships
   - Information flow
   - Context requirements

2. **Fusion Operations**:
   - Merge related chunks
   - Resolve references
   - Eliminate redundancy
   - Maintain coherence

3. **Context Assembly**:

   - Information density balancing
   - Metadata preservation

The fusion process ensures:
- Comprehensive context coverage
- Logical information flow
- Optimal response generation support

### 5.2 Response Generation

The system uses a structured prompt template for LLM response generation:
```python
prompt = f"""Based on the following context, please answer the question. 
If the answer cannot be found in the context, say "I cannot find specific 
information about that in the provided documents."

Context: {context}
Question: {user_query}
"""
```
